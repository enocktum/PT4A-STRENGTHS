# PT4A-STRENGTHS
DEVELOPER PROJECT
PT4A and STRENGTHS studies wants to develop an application that will enable the program to
care and support patients with chronic illnesses under the CDM(Chronic Disease Management)
program. To be able to do this it needs to generate a report of the cdm patients based on their
clinical encounters/visits. For each visit, the patient hypertension and diabetes data is recorded.
As a developer for the program you have been tasked with creating an application. The app
should be able to.

The counts represent the number of patients for that location and month who belong to the
different CDM Categories. These categories are
1. NEW HYPERTENSIVE - These are patients with htn_status of 7285
2. KNOWN HYPERTENSIVE - These are patients with htn_status of 7286
3. NEW DIABETIC - These are patients with dm_status of 7281
4. KNOWN DIABETIC - These are patients with dm_status of 7282
5. DIABETIC AND HYPERTENSIVE - These are patients whose htn_status and dm_status
are either new or known
The counts should be a link that opens a patient list of the specific category e.g Using the above
diagram as reference, clicking on the New Hyptertensive list for Location 1 should generate a
list of the 20 patients who fall under the new hypetensive category.
NB htn_status and dm_status are columns in flat_cdm_summary table.
